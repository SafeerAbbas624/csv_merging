Equipped with 6 mic/line channels and 3 stereo line channels, each has individual Gain, 2-band EQ, FX and PAN control with a 60mm Level fader. Mono channels also have individually switchable +48V phantom power and can accept a mic, line or instrument input. For live performers, a DSP effects section has 16 editable presets and can be activated remotely via a foot switch if needed. Balanced main outputs are joined by 2-track in and out, monitor out, headphones out and a Bluetooth receiver for wireless music playback. Uniquely designed end panels are supplied to enable installation into a 19"" rack or left off for free-standing operation. When rack-mounted, the CSR-63 occupies a little less than 4U height, allowing space to feed cables through the rear of the rack frame from the top-mounted connectors. The end panels also have adjustable depth fixing, enabling controls to stand proud of the rack for easy access or deeper behind the frame for protection. Unlike most rack mixers, this mixer has a shallow housing depth to allow back-to-back mounting with other equipment in racks with rear mounting strips. Overall, the CSR-63 can find its home in numerous different audio setups and provides a problem-solver for both installed and mobile PA systems.",Supplied with optional rack side panels (<4U height)[br]16-preset 24-bit DSP effects section[br]60mm level fader for each channel[br]Internal Bluetooth receiver[br]Individually switchable +48V phantom power[br]Power input at rear or underside for rack-mounting,"Power supply[tab]5Vdc, 2A (in-line PSU included)[br]Output[tab]Left + Right balanced XLR[br]Effects[tab]16 program DSP (24-bit sigma-delta, 40kHz)[br]Audio source[tab]Bluetooth receiver[br]Power consumption max.[tab]10W[br]EQ: low[tab]±15dB @ 80Hz[br]EQ: high[tab]±15dB @ 12kHz[br]Phantom power[tab]+48V individually switchable (XLR inputs only)[br]Input impedance : mic[tab]2k Ohms[br]Input impedance : instrument[tab]1M Ohms[br]Input impedance : line[tab]20k Ohms[br]Frequency response[tab]20Hz - 20kHz (±0.5B)[br]THD +N[tab]<0.03% @ 1kHz[br]Dynamic range[tab]102dB[br]Crosstalk : stereo[tab]92dB[br]Output impedance[tab]120 Ohms[br]Max. output level[tab]3Vrms[br]Inputs[tab]6 x combo XLR/jack + 3 x L(mono)+R jack[br]Dimensions[tab]482 x 160 x 90mm[br]Weight[tab]2.745kg",,Citronic,3.365,22/08/2024 8:48,250,"1,244,249,250",Mixers & Pro Audio -> Audio Mixers -> 19 Inch,mixers-pro-audio/audio-mixers/19-inch,0,159,https://www.avsl.com/assets/images/1/7/170809UK_CO7.jpg,https://www.avsl.com/assets/images/1/7/170809UK_CO2.jpg

173.303UK,NOD-2,Tube Man mkII Overdrive Pedal,Tube Man MKII Overdrive Pedal,"Genuine Tube-like sound that makes it more than your average Screamer pedal!   More gain ! That was the overall goal. If you’re not playing through a real tube amp, cranked for overdrive, it’s difficult to get genuine tube overdrive sound.   The original Tube Screamer pedals used an OP-AMP system, a basic circuitry that became popular for its “perfect amp” attributes. It had no distortion so it had to be overdriven or distorted by re-shaping the signal until it distorts (diode-clipping). Clipping it a little bit gives you Overdrive. Clipping it a lot gives you Distortion.  But there's a better way!   Using a FET Transistor System, which already has overdrive and distortion capabilities is a better approach to maintain the genuine sound you get from an actual analog tube amp. A FET allows you to bring out the harmonic attributes, and break-up the distortion into a finer grit, the way a real tube does.  Now, your leads will sing richer and longer, and your rhythm will be more open and expressive than ever before. It all culminates into an overdrive that is superbly dynamic, with crisp precise clarity that lets players cut through a dense mix, without losing fat mid-range.","Rotary drive, level & tone controls[br]True bypass / buffer bypass[br]Luminous glow-knobs for dark-stage environments[br]Strong and lightweight aluminium die-cast chassis[br]Requires 9V center negative DC Power Supply 75mA current draw (Not Supplied)[br]Compatible power supply 173.290UK",,,NU-X,0.29,21/03/2023 15:01,1153,"13,888,888,931,153",Music & Instruments -> Pedals -> NU-X -> Mini Core Series Effects Pedals,music-instruments/pedals/nux/mini-core-series-effects-pedals,100+,44.99,https://www.avsl.com/assets/images/1/7/173303UK_CO1.jpg,https://www.avsl.com/assets/images/1/7/173303UK_CO4.jpg

The Classical British rock tones of the 1970’s, packed into one little box.  How it works?   By using a hybrid of circuits, we created truly unique pre-amp and power tube distortion characteristics. You’ll be amazed to hear the warm, organic tone that’s reproduced.  Brownie has a specially designed BJT input stage causing it to “break-up” when the preamp tube starts to distort.  It also has an asymmetrical clipping circuit letting you simulate some of the characteristics of an actual tube amplifier. It also keeps the bottom-end tight by processing bass frequencies which can get muddy when distorted. Brownie uses a low-pass tone control filter to simulate the Variac effect (by lowering the voltage going into the amplifier) for rounding-off your tone. The range of tone is controlled yet perfect for dialing-in the high-end response.  The power clipping circuit is crafted from a modern low-noise op-amp and 2 red LEDs. It can create symmetrical clipping that distorts both halves of the signal keeping the sound smooth. True bypass circuits with a high quality TPDP mechanical foot-switch gives the bypass its phenomenal signal clarity.","Rotary gain, level & tone controls[br]True bypass[br]Luminous glow-knobs for dark-stage environments[br]Strong and lightweight aluminium die-cast chassis[br]Compatible power supply 173.290UK[br]Requires 9V center negative DC Power Supply 75mA current draw (Not Supplied)",,,NU-X,0.29,21/03/2023 15:01,1153,"13,888,888,931,153",Music & Instruments -> Pedals -> NU-X -> Mini Core Series Effects Pedals,music-instruments/pedals/nux/mini-core-series-effects-pedals,10+,44.99,https://www.avsl.com/assets/images/1/7/173304UK_CO1.jpg,https://www.avsl.com/assets/images/1/7/173304UK_LS10.jpg

Morning Star is a progression from the original blues breaker pedal with open soft clipping architecture, whereas The Horseman draws from the legendary centaur transparent overdrive circuit. Each overdrive has its own set of 3 rotary controls and effect on/off footswitch, which brings in a secondary function when held down for 1 second. Effect stacking order is switchable to give two different flavours of combined overdrive and each effect can even be switched remotely. Queen of Tone adds a switchable FET input stage to generate a more powerful signal for driving the front end of an amplifier, in addition to selectable buffered or true bypass output when the overdrive circuits are not engaged.

173.555UK,NSS-4,Pulse Impulse Response Pedal,Pulse Impulse Response Pedal,"Pulse is a miniature IR (impulse response) loader pedal, that can apply a specific tonal profile to the input signal. Speaker cabinets typically change the tone of a guitar or bass guitar in a musical way, which is often  collected using a microphone for sending to a mixing console for recording or sound reinforcement. Connecting the signal to a mixer before the speaker usually produces a sterile and harsh sound, which is where the Pulse pedal comes in. This pedal can mimic the speaker cabinet and microphone, meaning that the guitar signal can be taken straight from the preamp section and injected into a channel on the mixer. Another use for IR loaders is to mimic the response of an acoustic guitar, making an electric guitar sound more like an acoustic or an electro-acoustic guitar sound more natural. Pulse has modes for guitar cab, bass cab or acoustic guitar with 8 selectable types of each, adjusted by Level and Space controls. A 3.5mm headphone output means that this pedal can also be used for silent practice and an inbuilt audio to USB interface means that it can be used as the front end for a PC or Mac computer recording setup.

Each component can be edited by hitting the respective trigger and then adjusting parameters on the DM-7X sound module, with special effects to hand via the onboard rotary controls. Additional playing features include a selection of backing tracks, self-record function and drum coach for solo practice. Furthermore, the sound module can connect to a PC or Mac via USB for triggering sounds within a digital recording suite and for firmware updates. Stereo output to a PA is via L+R 6.3mm jack with a headphone output on stereo 3.5mm jack for silent practice, and an additional 5-pin DIN MIDI out is also provided for triggering external sound modules.

A USB-to-PC/Mac interface enables integration with a software recording suite as a trigger controller and sound source. Sounds from the flagship DM-8 kit are stored internally, along with additional world percussion instrument samples and the option to add user samples from a USB flash drive. Sounds are assignable to pads and adjusted using the intuitive user interface and control surface, and each pad has a dynamic indicator which varies in brightness to mirror the playing dynamics. Dedicated MIDI in and out connections mean that the DP-2000 can expand a live playing setup or operate from hardware sequencers and other MIDI controllers. In addition to tuning and dynmamics control, dual-engine DSP effects can be applied to each sound and tailored to suit each sound. If performance space is very limited, inputs for a hi-hat pedal, kick pad and an additional trigger can turn the DP-2000 into a fully playable super-compact e-drum kit.
